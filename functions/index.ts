// This file is the entry point for Firebase Functions if you deploy them.
// The actual Genkit flows for the Next.js app are located in 'src/ai/flows/'.
// The Firebase Functions build process (npm run build within the 'functions' directory)
// will compile files from 'functions/src/' into 'functions/lib/'.
// If you are creating HTTP-triggered Genkit flows or other Firebase Functions,
// their source code should ideally reside in 'functions/src/index.ts' or similar.

// The previous content of this file duplicated a Genkit flow definition
// which likely caused module resolution issues for the Next.js application.
// It has been cleared to prevent conflicts.

// Example of how you might re-export a flow for Firebase Functions if needed:
/*
import { csWhatsAppReplyHttp } from './lib/functions'; // Assuming compiled functions are in lib
export { csWhatsAppReplyHttp };
*/

// For now, keeping it minimal to avoid conflicts with the Next.js app's module system.
// If you have specific Firebase Functions to define here (not Genkit flows directly),
// ensure they don't conflict with your Next.js app's modules.

// If you intend to deploy Genkit flows as Firebase Functions,
// refer to the Genkit documentation for the correct setup,
// which usually involves using the Genkit CLI to deploy flows or
// setting up an HTTP trigger in `functions/src/index.ts` that calls your Genkit flow.

console.log("Root functions/index.ts is active. Ensure this is intended for your Firebase Functions deployment strategy.");
